**Last updated:** 27 July 2026

## Current Status

- Active phase: Phase 0 — Repository Preparation
- Last completed task: Task 0.2 — Create DesktopBridge abstraction
- Next task: Task 0.3 — Move renderer to DesktopBridge
- Blockers: None for Phase 0

## Completed Tasks

### Task 0.1 — Verify repository state

**Status:** Complete

**Files changed**

- `docs/migrating/progress.md` — created the migration execution log.

**Validation performed**

- Initial working tree: clean and synchronized with `origin/main`.
- `npm ci`: passed; the lockfile was unchanged.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm test`: passed (118 tests across 33 suites).
- `npm run build`: passed.

**Baseline observations**

- npm reports 16 high-severity advisories in the existing dependency tree.
  Dependency remediation is outside Task 0.1 and no package versions were
  changed.
- `docs/migrating/migration_tasks.md` provides executable tasks through Phase
  3. Phases 4–11 currently contain literal `...` placeholders. This does not
  block Phase 0, but no undefined task will be inferred when that boundary is
  reached.

**Blockers**

- None.

**Next task**

- Task 0.2 — Create DesktopBridge abstraction.

### Task 0.2 — Create DesktopBridge abstraction

**Status:** Complete

**Files changed**

- `src/desktop/contracts.ts` — added the runtime-neutral bridge contract.
- `src/desktop/electronBridge.ts` — adapted the existing role-specific preload
  APIs without importing Electron into renderer code.
- `src/desktop/DesktopBridge.ts` — added the renderer-facing integration
  boundary.
- `tsconfig.renderer.json` — included the new desktop bridge modules in
  renderer type-checking.
- `docs/migrating/progress.md` — recorded Task 0.2.

**Validation performed**

- Confirmed `src/renderer/` and `src/desktop/` contain no direct imports from
  the `electron` package.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm test`: passed (118 tests across 33 suites).
- `npm run build`: passed.

**Blockers**

- None.

**Next task**

- Task 0.3 — Move renderer to DesktopBridge.
